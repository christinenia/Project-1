For Project 1, my group and I were to adhere to the following requirements:
- Use 2 APIs
- Use AJAX to pull data
- Utilize 1 new library or technology that was not discussed in class
- User input validation
- Polished frontend/UI

Our client, Marco Di Maccio, a celebrity architectural wanted a clean, modern and minimalistic approach when creating his profile website.  He provided two inspiration pages, Dwell and Architectural Digest, so we utilized the sites’ APIs to display relevant content to the ‘Inspirations’ page.
